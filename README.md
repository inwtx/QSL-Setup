# QSL-Setup
This is a tutorial on how to install and setup QSL, a remailer client.  The client is used to send anonymous messages through remailers.  When sending emails through remailers, the sender remains anonymous and there can be no reply from the recipient.  An example why someone would want to use a remailer would be someone who wants to send an anonymous email to a police department, but does not want to become an instant suspect, which will always be the case when people injects themselves into a police investigation.

I. Download QSL here.  The download is on this line: The file you want is: QSLite-1.?.?.exe

II. Click on the QSLite-1.?.?.exe and it will ask where you want it to be unzipped.  This will  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be the folder where QSL then resides. The program will then continue with the Setup.

messages from being stored on your computer, delete the top 'Fcc: outbox' line.  Then save the default
message headers by clicking the menu 'File'/'Save as New Message'.
